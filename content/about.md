The Koderunners Community was started by a group of students passionate about coding and technology in order to bring a group of passionate and like minded people together. Our vision is to build a community where anyone could learn, collaborate and share code and ideas openly.

KoderunnersML is the official Developers' Pool of the Koderunners Community. We are a bunch of geeks crazy about Machine Learning and passionate about Open Source Development. We conduct research on new Machine Learning Methodologies, create clean and readable codebases and educational materials and undertake cool Open Source Projects.
